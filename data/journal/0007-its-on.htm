<h1><b>2023-08-28</b> It's on.</h1>

After scouting the social media and looking up the people from my
social circle, I've concluded the fight is on.

These nobody people have accumulated _wealth_ and _success_ by
simply being children of successful parents, this is not to say
that children shouldn't inherit wealth from their parents, but the
fact that some other folks who may not be all that successful have
entered into cooperation with such successful folks, made them
successful too.

I must make these people feel like shit, by being successful myself
without the help of others.

In a couple of years I'll surpass you in every field imaginable.

Enjoy suckers.
