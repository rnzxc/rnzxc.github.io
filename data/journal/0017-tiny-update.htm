<h1><b>2024-02-18</b> Tiny Update</h1>

<pre>
Here's some updates from me, it's not much, but I think its granted
throwing it out there, just so that my "imaginary" readers know I'm
still alive (and somewhat well).

Several things have occured in this month, I've bought myself an
ultrawide monitor so working on things is quite easier right now.

But then again, does it make me happy?  Not really, it just makes me
think about life, and question what are the true things that will
make you happy unconditionally.  I see this is becoming again one of
those rants, therefore I'm gonna stop right here, and move on to the
next topic.

My last journal was about **Task Marathons**, but not much was done
regarding that, mainly to do with the fact that other _more
important_ things have happened in the half of January and February.

Starting from here, I'm gonna be more active on this website, as
well as making some drastic changes to the journal page (or maybe
something in between the two), we'll see.

Now that I'm a little bit back on track as they say, I'm going to
plan out many things ahead of time, and try my utmost to stay atop
of them, at all times.

With the world being so hyper-active, I must take precautions to not
fall into the trap of being hyper-active myself, as that most likely
will lead to burnout and the lack of motivation to continue working
on anything at that point.

Even with so many personal struggles in life, regarding all sorts of
things, I still keep moving on, and that's what matters the most at
the end of the day.
