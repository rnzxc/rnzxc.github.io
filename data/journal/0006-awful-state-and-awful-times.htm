<h1><b>2023-08-24</b> Awful state and awful times</h1>

<pre>
It's been 20 days and I've done basically nothing.

I mainly focused on working on hobby projects that are probably a
waste of time anyways, but how can everything be a waste of time,
surely it can't right?

Well, let me tell you I've started online stalking some people from
my social circle, and that's the definitive approach to waste time
which is non-refundable.

Despite those things, the area where I live has been losing the
water supply for a long time, so I have lots of dirty clothes
piling up, as well as dishes and all that "great" stuff.

My mother is overseas and I'm here wasting my life for absolutely
nothing.  I'm using social media to extract as much OSINT as
possible, save it all locally, use some form of "advanced"
categorization for easy access and then probably disappear from the
internet, either partly or entirely.  Actually now that I think
about it I'll probably leave the accounts dormant i.e. they'll be
kept active but I won't log on to them, and this is so those people
writing to me can taste their own medicine, because I know they'll
eventually contact me for something, for extra measures I'll block
their phone numbers, although I don't have many numbers from "them"
and that's good.

This will be a direct hit to the assholes who don't seem to even
bother to look at the message I've sent. What a bunch of
cocksuckers who believe they've got it figured out.  But really the
question is what's wrong with me? I don't remember feeling this way
towards so called "ordinary people", or maybe I'm just maturing and
seeing the bigger picture, the real situation of this so called
"existence" which seems to be for nothing.

Many things are bad in my life, as a 20 year old I live in a fake
country and I don't mean that in a sarcastic way, it truly is a
fake country, with fake institutions, fake government, fake people.
Almost all the "friends" I've had in school, or rather haven't had,
seemed to fall off the earth, and frankly so, I actually like it
that way.  But, also I have no high school education, as if that
would've changed anything - it would really be a surplus of 2 to 3
years of wasted time basically into nothing valuable.  At least
this way I kind of had dedicated time into computers, and
programming on a daily basis.  And then there's the health
problems, bad vision, low energy, constant fatigue day to day, and
a plenty of more things that I don't deserve... I mean I'm saying
other people deserve this too, but when you look at the type of
people running the world, you start questioning the meaning of it
all.  AND, then there's a misbalance of proteins - I had gone to
chop wood for my relatives, and had the worst delayed onset muscle
soreness (DOMS) ever.  This is mainly due to the fact that I eat
shit, not food, but shit, to add insult to injury, I also drink
soda and "fruit juice", what else is there that I'm consuming that
isn't "unhealthy", oh yeah, there's nothing.  Such occurence is
made even more obvious when there's no fucking water available.

It's 21st century. The people's minds are rotted.
They never fill up the tanks, or have backups, but its not the
tank problem, it's the people.

---

Maybe all I need is some educational material, no internet, and
start focusing on how to make big bucks.

I must not detour myself into existential dread, that's where
success disappears, all will to live vanishes, and I don't want
that feeling present.

Things are shit, yes, and I will solve them.
