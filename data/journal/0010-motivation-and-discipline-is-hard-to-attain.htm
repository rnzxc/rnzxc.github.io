<h1><b>2024-01-07</b> Motivation and discipline is hard to attain.</h1>

<pre>
For the couple months, it's been really difficult trying to work on
anything that's truly meaningful to me.  I even took a break from
writing these journals, either because I didn't feel like it, or
because I had nothing that was interesting to write about.

Albeit the fact that I had written a massive journal couple weeks
prior, I'm still not planning on releasing it because I feel like
it's time to light up some fire under my ass.

Currently listening to some trance synthwave that's pretty chill,
and is giving me hope and the will to live, and do things.
Unhealthy behavior perhaps? Pretty much so.

Alrighty then, what I wanted to really say in this journal is that
attaining motivation and discipline in these times is real hard,
and yet it seems too much easier for other human beings; or are
they just more successful at masking their inadequacies.

But what am I any better?  I'm writing these journals behind a
pseudonym - and trying to act <i>tough</i> and <i>correct</i> in
every possible situation.  The truth is way more bleak than that.

I seem to have the urge to expose my own identity to the world,
in hopes that the people who are around me, at this time, may
eventually find this journal one day, and see what type of mental
hell and suffering I went through, and hopefully won't still be
going through it when I may eventually decide to speak up with my
own real name.

Then the question comes up, would that be safe for myself, and my
possible future family.  In my own point of view it probably would
not, but then I don't know.  Many successful people boast about
themselves and put their entire life on the spotlight for everyone
to see and know every detail about their "daily" routines, so who
am I to say the opposite.  Perhaps I'm a no one.

Eventually we'll see how the tables will turn.

Some things happened in my life, that gave me a wider perspective
when it comes to achieving difficult things, and seeing what all
the "success stories" are actually all about.

Luck and the right time plays a huge role, but being dedicated to
your craft is way more important than anything.

Time to continue the tasks, build discipline, and go against all
odds.

Thanks for indulging in this journal.  For future journals, I'll
try my best to keep rants as low as possible, as those rants just
screw my energy for the entire week it seems.

Have a nice day.
