<h1><b>2024-02-29</b> Internet, use it wisely.</h1>

<pre>
The internet is an amazing invention, it opens up so many doors and
opportunities for people who engage with it, ... or that is
something I would say 15 or 20 years ago.

In all honesty the internet has become an echo chamber, constantly
masquerading useless "information" to the masses via questionable
channels.

Search engines becoming more and more tweaked to the point where you
can't ever be an advanced user in the field, it's a mess.  I removed
all my domains from Google's Search Console, it's just not worth the
hassle anymore.

Then you get social media, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, etc.

Wanna know how people lived before these so called "technologies" ?

The answer is: You exist, so pretty much fine, if not better.

Which ultimately proves that these "platforms" are an utter piece of
time wasting shit, and that you're better off staring at the ceiling
while laying down in bed the entire day.

At least you may experience an outburst of interesting ideas.

Following right after this journal, I am blocking all social media
via local DNS rules, and will keep a single application on my mobile
device as the only realtime chatting client.

Nobody needs to nor should allow to be psychologically controlled by
these companies for some sort of "benefit for yourself" when in
reality the only ones in benefit are those giving you their time
wasting shit service for "free", but take your data as the
"license agreement" for them to earn millions from it.

If you're able to, get rid of all unnecessary bullshit, and use a
single app for every one and each task (that is; if you can), then
please fucking commit yourself to it.

Have relative ones who'll bitch about when you leave Facebook or
some other completely useless app?  Then tell them to go fuck
themselves in the ass because they don't deserve any better up until
that point.
