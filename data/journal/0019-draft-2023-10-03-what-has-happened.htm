<h1><b>2023-03-01</b> (draft 2023-10-03) What has happened.</h1>

<pre>
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  OLD POST - PUT HERE SO IT DOESN'T GO TO WASTE - ENJOY !

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This journal has been started back in 2023-10-03, and lots of things
have changed since I published my previous journal <b>Keep it to yourself</b>.

The way this journal differs from all the others is the fact that I have
put multiple timelines into one journal, so as to not waste my time
during these months of working by having to git commit each journal,
every single day.

In fact the timelines provided may or may not deviate that much, which
solely depends on my mood and the state I was in during the writing
of such journals.

I can't say nor confirm that any of the sub-journals written afterwards
in this journal will be concise in terms of story continuation, but most
of my journals are not therefore you may expect the same treatment for
these too.

Okay, let's get to the point.

As I explained in my previous journals, I go to bed very early, and wake
up very early too. Today I woke up at 6:20 AM and made myself and my
brother coffee.

He woke up at approximately 6:55 AM, the reason I know that is because
his alarm went off couple minutes later as I was sitting at the same
table. Up until that point it was 7 AM.

I was sitting there, browsing on my phone, reading some security blog
posts, he went on to take a shower, as he needs to go back to his
country of residence, or shall I say the country where he works.
It's mostly the only reason why he woke up early, other times he's just
sleeping throughout the day, or mindlessly wandering around with his
rented car - as always.

The reason he works "there" and not "here" is mostly to do with the
fact that he's well accustomed to the outside world, and the actual
reason why he chooses to go there I don't entirely know. But everyone
has their own reasons, and I won't go on to speculate or introduce
false premises.

But this isn't the main part of the bigger picture, or the bigger story.

The actual issue is that I'm seen as incompetent, due to my current
state in life when it comes to certain "accomplishments" and "failures"
and because of that I am always used as a punching bag.

My mom is also outside the country, she's working a tough job so she can
provide for us (mainly me and her), but that fact doesn't sit right with
me. Though my brother insists that the case is truly the other way
around, that is he thinks that I find that to be okay or that my time
spent (in his words: "wasted") is not amounting to any meaningful
progress for myself, or my future endeavours, and of course everyone
else.

As he's sitting there yelling and spewing out his story in a quite manic
way and trying to "project" his beliefs and structures of solving
problems (as if he has any "structures" ...), I am just being even more
fueled by the inner thoughts that I need to keep working harder and
harder to eventually come to the point of getting something for myself
and eventually leaving this place... Forever.

When I say leave, I mean leave everyone behind, I can't keep up with
this bullshit, I need to make something for myself, something of my own,
and I don't want to depend on anyone, ever. This isn't necessarilly
"starting a business" as that's just not possible at this time and with
my lack of experience with "people", but more so to have my own place,
my own peace, and continue working, growing, expanding from there.

As more months and years pass by, I am seeing that the people I'm with
are not really worth the effort. Would I subject myself to their
requests to do something a bit more "different" than my <i>expertise</i>
the answer to that is yes, for the most part, but there's a catch.

The only way for me to do things "differently" but fundamentally being
different, is to put myself in a different environment, with a
composition of different people and structures of existing. Or rather
with people who are not steaming with negative energy in every second
of the day.

While I do have certain privileges of not having to worry about many
things such as the electricity bill, the internet, water bill, food,
shelter, etc. it does not come without a cost, the cost being the mental
burden it's having on me is extraordinarily painful to even be writing
about it, and to put more fuel to the fire the fact that I have all the
other "problems" <b>I have to solve</b>, all constantly being accessed
in my head doesn't alleviate the pain, not one bit.

What's so intriguing from my point of view is that my brother, while
having a "job" outside of the country, and from my point having a decent
"life" in ways that he can afford things for himself, while I cannot,
and that's not something I made up. But see this, the guy is "working"
there for at least 5+ years, as of publishing this journal eventually
at around 2024, that would be 6+ years, and still he doesn't have his
own car, he doesn't own a house, the job he's working is not stable
meaning he often changes jobs and isn't actually fixated on anything
that the normal man would be. He's 28 years old and the thing he likes
the most is to lecture other people on "how to do things" but never
fully apply that to himself.

He doesn't have a girlfriend, and is most of the time rotting his brain
on TikTok and other bullshit platforms that are made for mind sedation
and brain cell rotting.

Did I say that he's also an alcoholic? Yes, a perfect mixture of all the
things that a human being can posses, that eventually you want nothing
to do with that human.

Are these words of mine too extreme? In fact, they are quite funny too,
and stupid at times, though I cannot change what's the truth, I can only
say it, write it down, and maybe someone believes or not, or maybe they
learn a thing or two, but really my problem with these people is that I
am willingfully stuck with them, and as unfortunate consequences that
occured many years ago due to my parents fighting, my father being a
slob his whole life, now I will need to figure shit out completely on my
own, as I don't have any actual support in a mindful aspect of things to
actually see the world for what it really is, and how to navigate it.

Truth be told I <i>sort of</i> know what the world is, it's a shit place
filled with fake people, fake ideas, and fake gurus. But what's the most
important thing to keep to oneself is to never fall to such a point like
these people.

My brother is often "good friends" with his cousin from the village not
far away, but that cousin is also a big fucking failure in life. I don't
exactly know his age, but from my recollection of mind he's probably
around 40+ years old, and guess what, he doesn't have a girlfriend/wife
either, also works a job he hates, and wastes it on alcohol and stupid
shit.                                Just making sure to point this out.

I'd consider my brother to be a good person, but to a point. He's trying
to be a guru, but he himself doesn't practice what he preaches.

Eventually near the end of the conversation, he began spouting how I
never made anything meaningful on the computer and that my knowledge is
a waste of time, and also that even if I was employed at a company I
wouldn't be able to sustain my employment as I didn't have any job
experience.

Do I find any of these statements useful? The answer is no, and not in
a way "Everyone knows nothing and I know everything" but it's just
common sense to me that the most things I do, and the most things I
know, I'd rather keep to myself.

As a side note, when you're done reading this journal, go back and read
my <b>Keep it to yourself</b> journal so you can more clearly understand
where I'm coming from and where I'm headed.

He also mentioned that I never made any "products" or more specifically
"software that delivered".

For that case, I would have gone and showed him what I made behind the
closed doors, but why would I fall that low?

Why would I jeopardize or self-sabotage my plan of reprogramming myself
to the point where I don't need to boast to <i>anyone</i> of my so
called <i>accomplishments</i> or <i>work</i>.

The things that I've put out there have been seen, under a different
alias for obvious reasons, and if you haven't noticed already, I am a
quite private and anonymous person for various reasons which I won't go
too much into detail, but it has to do with the fact that the people in
my country of residence that have certain expertise in technological
areas appear to be either misused or eventually targeted by some
criminal groups, and not in a way that you would like to hear or see.

  -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

If you really wanna know what I'm talking about, Google the
<b>David Dragicevic</b> story and eventually you'll see why.

  -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

It also doesn't help me with the fact that I was a ego-maniac throughout
my teenage years and to a point I still am but that's the main reason
why I keep my things secret for the most part, as I don't want to show
off to anyone, or let anybody know too much, even this journal alone
tells you a lot about me, about my position in life, about my location,
or whatnot. I'd rather not write these things down, but actually this
journal is for the most part meant to be "hidden" or "private", but if
you found these journals, then I guess congratulations wasting your time
on looking at my GitHub repositories or scanning my website for "hidden"
files.                                   Have fun reading my journals :)

Also to add this, if any of the journals I've written go dark, you can
most probably find them archived on web.archive.org, or archive.ph,
maybe some other sites too that I won't name. Forking this repository
will be considered disrespectful ;)

Alright, that's all I have for this sub-journal, I've been writing this
for an hour and 7 minutes, and now I have to go do my "job".

For future sub-journals, know that paragraphs separated with spaced
dashes "-- -- --" are used as a way to "bring attention" to specific
writing, whereas connected dashes "--------" are used to separate the
sub-journals one from another. You'll reach the send of a sub-journal
with my username, and the ISO 8601 identifying the date and time this
sub-journal was written. The date given is written when the journal was
started, modification dates will not be written due to unnecessary
complexity of maintenance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello again.  This snippet will span a lot of paragraphs and interesting
new details about my situation, and what I've done lately in this tiny
amount of time.

To get it all out right at the start, I have not made any significant
changes in these past couple of days.  While many things have taken
place, they are not worth mentioning here, as they're quite miniscule
compared to the things I will mention down below.

Alright, ready, set, go!

  -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

I've contacted several people to get a job position.
^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^

Why?  Because my personal hobby endeaveours are not realistic to the
point where I could sit back, do nothing, and still earn money.

What bothers me is the fact that in these couple of days I have tried
getting somewhere, I even contacted people that I truly hate and
despise in their full glory, my preconceived notions turned true when
I realized there was nothing in it for me.

Then 2 days ago this retard friend from high school messages me on
Facebook saying that the Dutch cocksucker is asking if I want to work
on a project of his.

I don't know if I ever mentioned this Dutch cocksucker in my previous
journals, but basically the guy does Web dev stuff, mainly in PHP with
OOP and bullshit paradigms like that, which I hate.. gist of the story
is that I used to work on a CMS platform with this retard friend of
mine and that Dutch cocksucker.  This retard friend of mine got paid
something, got himself a computer because he worked with this Dutch
cocksucker, which to be honest kind of restores my faith in humanity
a tiny bit, but then this retard friend of mine continued working for
several months on mini projects of this Dutch cocksucker and my retard
friend eventually never got paid - or maybe he did get paid and spent
the money on nonsense bullshit like any other teenager would (not
excluding myself) and then boasted about how he got scammed or
something.

This time the project is some sort of a DNS aggregate platform, a
Software as a Service (SaaS) type of deal.  I didn't hesitate to say
"yes" and while my retard friend objected to it in a negative manner,
and then laughed at the offer I was given if the service went popular,
and that's a big fucking <b>IF.</b>

Offer I was given was 4% of total monthly earnings. Is that laughable,
it most definitely is. Considering the fact that I already wasted 2
fucking days implementing API wrappers with mixed results all over the
place because some pajeet worked on the API interface for all these
domain brokers, registrars, management sites, and whatever they're
called I don't give a fuck.

Let's say at the launch of the service the total monthly earnings are
to be estimated around 500 euros, and this is being way too optimistic
about it, even if the guy told me that he has web agencies that work for
him and similar bullshit of that nature, so 500 euros times 0.04 is how
much?

  20 euros (with my currency in BAM would be around 40)

Do I say I'm happy with that? Not really, but then again we have to look
at the bigger picture here.

What's the actual mover here?  What is making me wanna waste my time
that I will never get back by working on someone elses project by
knowing I'm not being paid by the hour, and that this whole idea could
quite easily flop the second the service goes live?

We'll here's the thing.  I am reprogramming myself, I am reinventing
myself, and this is my approach of doing it.

I have personally noticed that most of the time I used was wasted on
nothing, just nonsense, and stupid discussions with people on Facebook
that I used to have when I was 10 to 15 years old, and all those
conversations eventually amounted to nothing.  Yeah people know a thing
or two about me, but what do I get in return?  This made me realize that
I need to do something truly realistic and risky for myself, I need to
take the first steps, because nobody else was there in my life to guide
me in the first place.

Parents divorced, disfunctional family and relative ones, no actual
friends or real support from anyone, most life been there faking my
enthusiasm just to make others feel good, etc.

But now that I'm older (, and hopefully wiser) I am starting to see what
and how people actually behave, and what they're looking for.  Most of
us are looking for acceptance, by someone, and this is my way of
accepting someones idea, even if that idea at the end of the day may
extremely flop, time wasted, everything lost, and whatnot.

In reality by looking at it from a different point of view, for me it's
not about the idea, or the profit (this is not say I'm not here for the
profit, of course I am but the philosophy applies differently in this
instance...), actually I am here to stress test myself, and build
endurance when working under virtual pressure.

It's so easy to turn into a bitch like I used to in the past, and just
leave out the opportunity, disappear, go offline.  That mostly had to
do with social anxiety, and while I still suffer from it on a daily
occasion, I try to put myself through uncomfortable situations, as that
often shows me after the fact that things aren't that scary, and that
everyone is just thinking of themselves.

And this same philosophy applies to this Dutch cocksucker and my retard
friend.  They all wanna do and show something for themselves, and I'm
not gonna say I'm not victim of that, because I am.  These journals in
a way show that picture very clearly.

Either way we went way off the tangent here, the point of the story is
that I don't know what will happen.  The guy could be playing a game
with me, or something of that nature, but think about this.

Maybe I'm having the preconceived notions like everyone else, by taking
what someone else said as the core fact regarding their story or a
particular situation that occured within that story.  And I'm talking
especially about my retard friend who seems to have been "scammed" by
this Dutch cocksucker, even though he got a brand new computer that this
Dutch cocksucker ordered?!  This often leads to misleading conclusions
because they're not actually rooted in truth, as you can't necessarily
draw facts from someones opinions (or maybe you can?) but there needs to
be common sense and wisdom mixed into one another to actually get to a
conclusion that adheres to the fabric of reality and nature of logic.

Still I'll try to work on projects of his for a couple of months, we'll
see where that goes, but it will not be my main focus.  You'll see why
in my next topic.

  -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

Contacting the well known Web developer scammer from Bosnia named
E7D4N D3L1C.  See what I did there?  I intentionally <i>obfuscated</i>
his name so that he can't find this journal when he Googles himself,
he does it like any other egotistical piece of trash, that's also a
whiny and bitchy girl whenever his point of view is opposed by someones
opinion.

I contacted him because I used to help him out with AdSense and shit
like that, mainly scripts and stuff of that nature.  I also did some
web demos for him which I have written in my previous journals so you
can try and look it up somewhere here.

Sent him a message asking something like "hey man, ..., I'm looking for
work, ..., do you by any chance have contacts of people in need of such
service", the "service" being "Web Developer".

We talked for some time, I spit out some lies, this that, and I lied
a lot because I don't wanna let this turd know what I'm doing, as he's
like that.  He constantly asks questions, and demands answers.  If you
don't deliver he'll deem you suspicious or selfish in some of his many
ways of fucking with your head and the tiny bit of nerves you have left.

And what would you know, he gave me 3 direct phone numbers of people
running e-marketing tightly bundled with nutra manufacturing firms, aka
huge fucking scams, and I wouldn't be surprised if their firm were also
also used as money laundering funnels as the last time I looked at their
earnings there were packing some big bucks for such a tiny number of
people.

These are folks such as Ajdin Brkovic, Esef Cosic, and some other shit
heads that wanna make an example of themselves as "visionaires".

Eventually I messaged this shit head from my local area, which turned
out he was with his "team" out in India on some bullshit marketing
conference that nobody should ever be discussing about, let alone paying
for a plane ticket and traveling there to be "present in the moment",
and that means I didn't get an answer.  I waited for 3-4 days and I went
on their official website, which looks like ass, simple prebuilt
template that they just "find & replace" and uploaded to their domain,
just like E7D4N D3L1C does ;), and I went ahead sent the necessary
information via the job application form.

Hopefully I get a decent message back and see what happens, but it'll
most definitily, 100%, amount to nothing but wasted time with the shit
head balkan people.

I don't know what else to say, I'm lost. That's it for now.

                                             rnzxc - 2023-10-17 03:37 AM

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some time has passed, still nothing.  I got no answers back, some other
nonsense occured in life;  TL;DR things are going to the shitter day by
day.

Even some of my <i>friends</i> are making some progress (or at least I
see it that way) meanwhile I'm here sitting in this molded room of mine
with so little oxygen for my brain to work properly, trying to
brainstorm things and get myself out of this rut.

But then again these are my behavioral tendencies to day dream about
unrealistic comebacks.  And to who am I <i>coming back</i>?  In all
honesty I almost became numb towards everyone so that I can maybe
leverage some chill brain waves while trying to work on my things.

I had that feeling, and I know how much productive I can be, but that
inner thought on the side of my mind tells me and shows me the real
picture of the world and the situation that I'm in.

This sub-journal reminds me of my bitching times, but no I'm not trying
to bitch about anything, If I ever felt like I was doing that I would
immediately crumple the journal and start all over again.  While it's
not bitching, it's just me trying to get out the most of it from my
system, having nobody else that I can talk to and that they'll
understand what I'm saying, and not fuck me over because of the things
I've said or how I'm dealing with my situation, then the need for these
journals wouldn't exist.

Yesterday I went out with two of my friends, the 2nd friend I did not
expect to be there but who cares, I hope these assholes hit the bottom
of their lives harder than I ever did being surrounded by such assholes.

And my views on these people always prove true, but I don't wanna put
myself down and feel like shit for the rest of the day trying to talk
and explain the situation of these <b>nobody people</b>.  If you really
wanna get some overall description, go read my previous journals and
maybe you can leverage some sort of <i>closure</i> from there.

Currently I'm rehearsing my backlog of checklist items and crossing any
item that makes no fucking sense at all - I have plenty of those.

My overall focus for now is general Web development, security research,
etc.

I'll be spending the 2/3 (two thirds) of 2024 developing my in-house
tools specifically for the purpose of web development and security
research.  Many of the programs available on the market (enterprise, or
else) are all but a bunch of trash, now not all of them are that bad,
but when you're missing a very well known and crucial feature, that
despite people continously asking for it to be added but you won't do it
then that means that I need to take matters into my own hands.

Such endeaveour won't target public audiences, It's gonna be my own tool
and it's gonna definitely bring me cold hard cash, because what has this
world and the society ever brought me?  Most definitely nothing.

As of writing this sub-journal, I am sketching out the processes that
need to take place in the upcoming weeks in order to re-evaluate the
tasks layed out in the checklist, I've had and Am still coming up with
great ideas that need executing, it's just that many of those ideas have
been stuck in the backlog for the past couple of months.  Lot's of great
ideas that would highly benefit and improve my overall workflow.  The
amount of time I've saved with my command aliases in Windows and Linux
is incredible, only God knows what that time difference will be once I
have these CLI and GUI metaprograms finished.

Alright, I'm out.  Will be posting some more sub-journals and journals
with their own topics very soon :)

Hello again.

Another day, another journal, where I waste mine and your time.

10 Days before the New Year starts.  Yaaay.  I will spent that time with
a retard friend who said he'll get a steering wheel from this uncle and
then I'll have to listen to and watch his "creative endeaveour" content
which is A. not funny, and B. quite fucking retarded.

This for now is just temporary, once the new year time passes, I'll
go offline from my Discord account and use the other one to conversate
with my cousin related to work.  If that also doesn't work out (as many
things have not worked out) then I'll completely disappear from the
internet, under a different alias entirely.  But the fact that you're
reading this may indicate that I may already have done so.

At least I may find solace in that time with the steering wheel, sounds
like a fun thing.

The last 30 days I've been getting lots of promises, and been working
back with my cousin on some websites that he's thinking about
over-engineering...  Just like your typical web developer.

I've gotten a laptop for that also, gave back the old one to the
person I was lending it from, and now I'm typing this nonsense on this
"new" laptop which is from 2016 by looking at the specs page.

I was promised to be earning a decent amount the first 3 months, but
I'm yet to hear anything more to that.  I did some bullshit tasks on a
WordPress page - yeah, all my skill turned into working on WordPress.

While that beta male cuck cousin (33M) who sent my sister nude photos
couple years back figures out what the fuck he wants to do, I'm gonna go
back to working on actual projects I find fun and that will actually
benefit the society in some way, as opposed to this money and knowledge
quackery these types of "experts" continuously present and sell.

                                             rnzxc - 2023-12-21 04:24 PM
