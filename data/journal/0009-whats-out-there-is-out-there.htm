<h1><b>2023-10-30</b> What's out there, is out there.</h1>

Reading upon security and privacy, and then trying to apply
realistic terms to personal information has been quite hard for me.

As someone who dabbles with such things, I must begin treating my
digital footprints more seriously, and while these journals are
extremely opposite of that, there's much more stuff that's not out
there.

But even with that being said, some things still manage to leak out
or simply become forgotten or missed, and then when the time comes
to try and remove that bit of information, you're unable to.

Because you either deleted your 2FA keys of the email accounts,
and then you deleted the email account that was used to create the
profile on those particular platform(s) hosting the data that was
not supposed to be public, etc.

I often look back at the email address I used to have as my main,
and then ask myself <i>Why did I delete it?</i>, because ultimately
there was nothing on those emails, like literally nothing, aside
from particular accounts that I created with that same Email that
now I can't access ever again and get rid of the information that's
out there.

The alias I use online has been used for many years, so if you try
looking for information about me, you won't find much, and if you
do it's probably gonna be from bulletin boards and things that
Google Groups has deliberately archived for the entire world to see
and <i>laught</i> at.

But then again, Google is a giant shithole that's been getting
worse and worse, and I do support that for privacy reasons, if it's
more difficult to find information about me, than that's a plus for
my well-being.

Also, I wish one day there will be some extreme tech-based leak on
4chan where all the internal tools and source code of all these big
tech companies gets published, these cocksuckers deserve a payback
from the public.
