<h1><b>2024-01-09</b> The next tool on mind</h1>

<pre>
Last tool I worked on is done.

The next tool to do, is a JSON visualization tool.

It is a huge undertaking I think, because I need to develop an
appropriate UI and UX model for an advanced tool.

Truly be told, I do not want my tool to be a "toy", instead I want
it to be a toolbox, an advanced one for that does one job, and does
it right. so I'm gonna start slowly.

Build the prototype, see how it behaves, and then after some trial
and error, rewrite it in a more maintenance free hassle approach,
where I don't need to glue thousands of libraries from 3rd parties,
instead I will make all the libraries myself :) - how about that
"senior web developers".

I may even release it on my other profile as open-source, but that
last paragraph may just be a lie, if it turns out to be a hell of
a lot useful, then I will.  Under a price.
