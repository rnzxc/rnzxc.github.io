<h1><b>2023-08-01</b> Contacted by a wannabe web-dev asshole</h1>

Couple days ago I was browsing Facebook and got a message request,
it was my so they say "old friend" which is a huge cocksucker and
the biggest self-centered douchebag that rules all them other
self-centered douchebags.

He just wrote "You alive?" and I didn't even bother to accept it,
I just went through and deleted the message.

Lots of months ago maybe even years, I did some web app demos for
him so he could do a so called <i>presentation</i> to <i>somebody</i>
so I did in expectation that I would get paid.

Instead all I got was a sleepover, drinking cheap energy drinks,
eating some shitty nutella clone, and also to add insult to injury
the guy was basically in a "basement" ... like LITERALLY.

So I was gasping for air at the same time, hacking away on this old
laptop of his building the so called "web app demo".

After I finished I expected payment but all I got was "Thanks."

What a piece of shit, and the thing is he begged me couple days prior
to come and work on the thing because he really needed it, and that I
would be "paid".

At that point before leaving, I would have probably yelled at him, or
have chosen a more sane approach to alleviate the situation at hand,
but I didn't because his mom was right there.

And so I <i>went with it</i> and gotten into the car with his mom and
she dropped me off at my address.

Through that whole ride I was contemplating my life choices and
questioning my entire existence.. as if I wasn't already doing that
before I even went there in the first place.

Couple months later I've gotten the Login credentials of his moms
Gmail account which I won't get into how I acquired, you can go and
watch these wanna-be hackers and script-kiddies on YouTube sucking
huge cocks for VPN ads recording "how to hack x" videos for that.

Then I went in and changed lots of things, deleted many accounts, and
basically wreaked havoc on the entire account.

Fuck these people. They don't deserve the success they get, but even
more I don't deserve to be treated like shit, and to also take it all
in at the end.

Again. Fuck these people.
