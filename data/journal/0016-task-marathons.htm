<h1><b>2024-01-13</b> Task Marathons</h1>

<pre>
This is my new proposal (for myself) which is about doing tasks as a
marathon, in 4 hour intervals.  The marathon itself is a high
intensity workload task, where there may be multiple sub-tasks
included that each must reach a final goal before the marathon ends.

A maximum of 3 marathons per day should be sufficient enough,
where in a month we'd have about ~90 marathons finished on average.

In other words, a marathon is like brainstorming, but in a way that
is already pre-defined.  If we have a kanboard with a list of tasks
that need prioritizing and finishing, we use marathons to entirely
dedicate time to those tasks, and have them <i>hopefully</i> be done
before the marathon ends.

Here's a timeline of 3 marathons per day:

         05:30 AM  -  Wake up (9 hours of sleep at best)
+00:30   06:00 AM  -  Marathon #1 starts.
+04:00   10:00 AM  -  Marathon #1 ends. 1 hour break time
+01:00   11:00 AM  -  Marathon #2 starts.
+04:00   03:00 PM  -  Marathon #2 ends. 1 hour break time
+01:00   04:00 PM  -  Marathon #3 starts.
+04:00   08:00 PM  -  Marathon #3 ends.
+00:30   08:30 PM  -  Go to sleep (wake up at 05:30 AM)

Break time should be used to do tasks other than those prepared for
the marathon, things such as breakfast, coffee, anything, is to be
performed during break time.

Additionally, we may shift the break time before a marathon has
begun, for example we can allocate 30 minutes before and after
a marathon.  But this will yield less break time between multiple
marathons.  This approach may be taken only after a couple of weeks
once you've got the hang of the marathons themselves, and you've
started to enter into the discipline of doing task marathons.

Before a marathon has begun, anything you want close in the reach,
need be close to you, such as a water bottle, a drink, etc.

The marathon is not just a "tasks need get done, fast", but actually
it's a form of a brain exercise, where we try to enter a flow state
in a more consistant form.  During each marathon, a tiny timer
window needs to be running in the bottom right corner of the screen.

This time indicates the remaining minutes, once the end has been
reached, we flash the window (we don't want to use any sounds so as
to not affect the workflow by immediate and/or unexpected stimuli).

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Regarding focus
===============

Because marathons are highly intensive tasks, requiring full focus
and all energy available at the spot, we block all access to sounds,
music, social media, videos, etc.

Where social media is a special exception;  Social media access
should only be permitted on Sundays, and Sundays only!

There are many reasons why that is which we will not get into right
now, but that is the ultimate rule at hand.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Use a physical paper to write down the progress
===============================================

Have a completely empty paper that you'll use to write down the
progress of marathons, when each marathon has concluded.

Things such as the number of hours + minutes spent on a marathon,
alongside the number of all tasks present, tasks finished, and tasks
not finished.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Tasks not finished
==================

Taking a realistic approach to this discipline building lifestyle,
eventually some tasks will not get finished during the marathon.

Tasks not finished are to be put in the queue at the top of the
next marathon, or the marathon that depicts a particular project
whose tasks we're not all finished.

A marathon itself is just a list of tasks that need finishing in a
4 hour interval.  And those tasks need to be worked on in full focus
with zero distraction whatsoever.

If required, lock the door so no one can get into your house to
bother the living fuck out of you.
