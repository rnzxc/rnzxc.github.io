<h1><b>2024-03-08</b> That Happened Quickly</h1>

<pre>
I worked for my cousin on a couple of projects. Some weeks passed,
sent him some messages, he doesn't reply to any of them, I do
understand he's busy and stuff.

So I stop sending messages for some time, couple weeks pass, I ask
him "Hey man, what's up?" Nothing much, this that.

Then I ask him about the projects, what's next? etc.

He starts rambling about how he didn't expect to come to this
"conclusion" of his, meanwhile I'm great at what I do, I wasn't so
much focused into it, and how I'm probably not that interested in
the project after all.

Motherfucker, I did everything that was in my power.

Anyway, just wanted to write this cause I'm a bit fumed right now,
nothing crazy but just need to get this shit outta my system.

At least now I've got a reason to focus on the tasks that will
bring actual fucking knowledge, and hard earned cash, instead of
doing OOP and just fucking stupid Docker-based shit altogether.

You are your only true friend, everybody else is the enemy.
