<h1><b>2023-08-02</b> My social circle is rotting my brain</h1>

<pre>
Today I woke up about 11 PM, I spent some time on the computer,
drank a cup of coffee as usual, which is something I've tried to
avoid countless times but I end up returning to the old habit of
being a slob of a person and simply falling back into the same old
rut of consuming this shit.

We'll get into the topic of consuming shit later, but let's focus
on the main story, and that's my social circle, or lack thereof.

<hr>

So I finished drinking my cup of coffee, and went onto Messenger
to check on some Messages in the Restricted Accounts area.

...of course I've restricted the messages of many assholes from my
so called "social circle" just to end up looking at them anyway...

Now that I think of that I'm going to go back and add some more to
the list, they really do deserve it. Maybe I should just outright
block them entirely, I don't need to see them living "good" fake
lives, these people would not give you a drop of water if it made
a decision between life and death, that's the type of people I'm
surrounded by.

And this asshole which I'm gonna call O.H. messaged me yesterday
to go with him so he can get a haircut, at first I didn't want to
but as always me being the "good" guy.. always, I said sure.

So about 3:30 PM I went with him so he can get a haircut.

Now read carefully.. through the entire trip the guy behaved like
a man child, he made nonsensical "jokes", talked about sex,
fucking, penetration, etc.

Yeah this is to be expected by teens, right.. right ??

But now and then when I try to start a serious conversation it
always deviates downhill from there, always being talked over by
such idiots who never actually had any meaningful of valuable
discussion to give, these people are leeches, they look over to
try and gain something from you, either financially or spiritually
by either using you as a emotional support or outright as a boxing
bag, and for me both cases apply at the same time.

The people I surround myself by are enormous pretentious assholes
who I'd rather see not existing anymore, ever, is that really a
bad thing to say?

The so called "society" says so, but maybe if you've got a
breadcrumb of a braincell to be able to hold your opinion to
yourself before I go on to write more journals which are going to
be contiuations of the previous journals, in which I'll be
explaining more thoroughly what's really happening and how I'm
going about these things as a loner and as a socially awkward
male, THEN you can make your own judgements but either way I don't
give a fuck what you think, so just keep on reading because you
find this perhaps interesting or mildly amusing.

Story continues... He got his haircut, we went out, the guy was on
his phone messaging someone, and remember this isn't the "only"
time he's on the phone, this guy is 24/7 on his phone, every time
I went out with these people they're all on the phone, I try to
somewhat "relate" to them by using the phone too, and then in the
meantime try and deviate from that behavior onto more meaningful
conversations and social connections, but it never worked.

I understand when puberty hits, people wanna do crazy shit, and
they should be doing crazy shit, hanging out with friends, getting
drunk, having a relationship, losing virginity, etc. But come the
fuck on, this isn't really puberty at play, this is my social
circle, and maybe even the society as a whole, being re-programmed
by social media or by some other outside social norms that people
on the outside or on the internet have imposed on them.

I tried countless times to be "normal" but it doesn't seem to
work, the reason it doesn't work is also the main reason why I
started this journal in the first place, and also why I'm choosing
to go the path that I took, the path that I'm going to explain in
my upcoming journals.

What the previous paragraph really focuses on is the core true
fact, and that is that I have to "disappear", the "disappearing"
part doesn't necessarily mean that I need to ignore these people,
but in the long run I do have to ignore these people. Perhaps
counter-intuitive, yeah? But I don't have anything to lose by
doing this, maybe a part of my sanity but that could be
maintainable.

I must shift my time and focus towards important things, important
topics, things that actually affect the quality of life, what I'm
eating, when I'm sleeping, what's my daily routine, how am I
managing myself mentally and spiritually, is the work I'm doing
being done in good faith, am I working out either by walking or
running, am I maintaining a stable height to weight ratio, and
many more things.

I must stop thinking about non-sensical topics, things, and just
people in general. All these people have some "success" one way or
another, but that success is partly due to the fact that their
family is "stable" enough to warrant any success as opposed to my
family tree which is all but a bunch of failures in life, and just
anything generally meaningful to the world.

My current state as a 20 year old, without a job, a good social
circle, a girlfriend, stable family, living with constant anxiety
and fear of the inevitable or uncontrollable, is truly taking a
toll on my psyche, even as I'm writing this journal I am fully
self aware of the time I'm wasting as this journal will most
definitely bring nothing to the table, but maybe it does bring
something.. to someone, by either reassuring them that they're
not the only one in this situation, and that other people exist
in the world who are battling the same situation and problems in
their life and they probably won't speak up their opinions infront
of people as themselves so they have to hide under mysterious
aliases in order to actually fully express themselves without
catching any wind in the process.

The summary of the story is to try to the fullest extent to work
hard, even when you don't feel like it, to try and build something
for yourself, for the future, and maybe even for your children.
You really never know where the world is going to take you, but it
almost won't take you anywhere if you actually don't take any
action and continue living in this fantasy world that "things are
fine" and everything will eventually get worked out by itself, no
it will not. As a man it takes a lot of effort, a lot of energy,
dedication, and patience to actually achieve something and become
a self-sustaining person.

Joining these Discord chatrooms with these so called "friends" of
mine is nothing but a perpetual machine of toxic wasteland and "he
said" or "she said" mentality bullshit. I am a victim of that
myself, and I need to guide myself in life, because the "system"
and the "society" haven't guided me anywhere, not even my family
was there when I needed them the most.

As a child I went through a lot of trauma because of family
problems and I still suffer from it today, to some extent it may
even be worse due to the fact that I need to lit up some fire
under my ass and start making some shit for myself, and stop
wasting my fucking precious time and life on these nobody people.

All in all, this journal is here so I can let off some steam, it's
mostly here so it serves as a "communication" between somebody,
that somebody is me, but it's easier on the psyche when you know
you've let it all out and you don't need to keep it in anymore.

If nobody else listens, maybe someone will.
