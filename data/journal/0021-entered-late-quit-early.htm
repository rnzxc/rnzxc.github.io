# QUICK INTRODUCTION

This the last time I'm giving any of my time to these nobody
assholes.  I've been conditioned for years to believe they were
ahead, but soon enough I came to realize how wrong I was this entire
time...

I got tricked into using drugs, tried MDMA, speed, had some fun time
but that is quickly overshadowed when I realized I was being played
the whole time.

I'm so extremely fed up with all of them, that I'm gonna expose
their identity very quick, and now :-)

- Osman Hasic (Malac) --- 2003
- Omer Fazlic (Oma) --- 1994
- Osman Hasic (Osmance) --- 1998
- Amar Piragic (Pirgo) --- 2003
- Edita Malkic --- 2004
- Ismar Besic --- 2004
- Ajla Mesaljic --- 2003 (guessed)
- Damir Hasic (Haski) --- 2004 (guessed)
- Nusmir Buljubasic (Nusko) --- 2001

... Many more to come ;-)

All of these above are HUGE FUCKING SNAKES and I don't wanna spend
more than 5 minutes near these hacks of people.

# DRUGS

Actual motivation behind me consuming cheap drugs with these leeches
was the reason that I felt a part of friendship I haven't felt in a
long time.  But then reality struck - you fight over genuine advice
with your brother, to end up going out with these losers to have so
called "fun".  Such "fun" consisted of Osman sitting and bitching
about everything, and constantly trying to assert himself in the
middle of each sentence, always trying to win someone over, over
anything.  A truly spoken manchild :-)

Omer being ohn the passenger side, drinking beer and playing the
casino game on his phone, day in and dayout.

And me sitting in the backseat "acting" as if I'm having so called
"fun".

Only fun I had was being able to drive around with these idiots
because it was the only time I could unwind from the "moment".

Main reason I did this to myself was that I wanted to get outside my
room into the world a bit, but that's a big flaw in my model of
decision making.  Now that's a great idea to construct my "Model of
decision making" - but that's something to do in my own spare time
;-)

Now... now now now... The final part.

I took my head out so to speak for these people.  I borrowed money
from others so I could give it to them, I helped with things free
of charge, and I ended up being the worst and the weirdest?

# FUCK YOU ALL

How about we switch from mode A to mode B?
How about I stop giving a fuck about that what you think?

YOu assholes couldn't get over the night when I took MDMA and
somehow "went overboard" meanwhile I was there fully self aware, the
most chill of you all.  The "tough guy" was pissed, went home,
blocked me on INstagram, Facebook, probably my phone number as well
hahahaha...

Are these your so called "friends" fuck no.

All of them leech off their parents, while I'm the ONLY ONE working
towards not being that.

I sold my monitor so we could go out have fun, I stole money from my
brother, same.

And I end up being the biggest scum?

Maybe I should leave a crater in your faces motherfuck pieces of
shit.

I give you my finger, you want the entire arm?

I fucked up my job position because of this trash, these are not
humans, these are trash.

And now nobody has to pay but me.
