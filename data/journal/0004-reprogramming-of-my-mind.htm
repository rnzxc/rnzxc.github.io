<h1><b>2023-08-03</b> Reprogramming of my mind</h1>

<pre>
It's 8:10 PM as I'm writing this, so I only have 50 minutes to fully
write out this journal.

Today marks the day when I start reprogramming my mind. It sounds way
too ambitious but I am going to fully commit to the task, not just day
by day, but second by second.

I will verbally assault myself whenever I start thinking of doing
something illogical or letting the external forces effect my psyche
in a negative way.

Couple hours ago I contacted an old friend of mine from high school,
I helped that cocksucker with everything, I was always there 24/7
in the chatrooms, and now when I'm asking for a favor nobody answers.

At the end I may go crazy or eventually heal my soul by simply reading
these people and decoding their behaviors in a more thorough way where
it benefits my overall opinion about the humanity and also affects how
I deal with my preconceived notions day to day.

What's more important is to not necessarilly focus on that aspect of
the story, it's just a side note I wanna keep and to use that as a
reminder whenever I start thinking something else that may be related
to that concept but not necessarilly "beneficial" in any meaningful
way.

As a teenager I spent most of my time daydreaming and thinking what
others thought of me, so in turn it made it so that I was thinking of
them, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they were thinking of me.
In most cases they weren't thinking of me, or if they were it was just
as a story on the side to tell someone about, and those stories were
usually not nice as they mostly induced "preconcived notions" in
peoples minds and thus why I am fucked up to this day.

I notice that many people from the outside seem to believe they "know"
me all too well, and even though I am fully aware that that is not the
case at all, my mind is still "conditioned" to believe it may be the
case. But this is again one of those "programmed" behaviors where the
mind was conditioned by external forces and life experiences to default
to that thought pattern, without actually assessing the situation in a
more practical and logical term or definition.

So this is where my social anxiety kicks in, it mostly has to do with
the fact that my mother was abused by my father when I was a child, and
as a child I could not do anything but look at the situation and cry,
or yell. The biggest issue is that the help never came, it always
amounted to the <i>same old story</i> where things just kind of
"cooled off" but still the scars in my mind run deep.

Often I get the feeling that world is unfair, and that things could've
been better if my parents were smarter and more diligent about their
position in life before I was conceived, or that their parents had a
bad influence, or maybe weren't critical enough of them to make a big
impact for themselves personally (the children).

And this goes hand in hand with my situation, where my mother never
told me to do anything worth of doing, it was always just mumbling
around and talking gibberish, and watching Serbian-Croat-Bosniak
retards arguing about 5G cooking our minds. Basically there's no
external forces that actually benefit my psyche as a 20 year old male,.

Many of my friends may appear to be in a better spot than me, but I
can't say for sure because I don't know their lives personally nor
their true interests, and intentions with the future.

But I do see a pattern where if either one of their parents is at least
successful to some degree where it grants them connections with the
outside world, they immediately appear to "step up" in life as opposed
to those who just have mediocre connections with every day people who
don't actually have anything to bring to the table.

This makes me believe that the world is unfair, but again the world
may not be unfair because someone has to make that initial move,
someone has to break that barier and open a new chapter for themselves,
for their family, and maybe if they wish so for their social circle.

Couple months ago I've sent a job application to a nearby company that
makes windows and doors, they looked for a Software developer.
I quickly made and sent them a CV via Email, nobody responded.

Then a couple weeks ago there was a job application listing again,
for the same company, this time I decided to ask my cousion to land
me the phone number for the Senior Software Engineer of that company,
so I wrote some messages via Viber directly and gotten the date figured
for an interview.

I was all happy and filled with joy because I thought I may be able
to express myself and actually show the admiration and dedication I've
got towards the projects I've worked on.

Do you know what I got instead? That this wasn't enough.

This fat fuck who probably had 200+ kilograms who I'm going to name
A.J. said to me that this wasn't enough.

You fat pig I've built my own JS library, I wrote my own documentation,
my own demos page. And not only that, I've showcased many more projects
that were waaaaay more advanced than anything they were doing there.

That smelly pig said they mainly work with React, SQL, and some other
mumbo-jumbo bullshit tech stack that has made the entire world the shit
it is today.

I'm sitting there and thinking "I thought I'd get a job here, but I
guess it's time to go back to the drawing board and do you own thing"

And so that moment when I got out of the building, I knew what I had
to do.

I knew I had to hide my identity, close down on social media, abort all
plans with my so called "friends" or whatever the fuck that means
anymore, and just simply go back to the drawing board and rethink the
situation at hand.

All my peers appear to be having the moment of their life, while I'm
here pretending as if I'm "doing work" without actually fully comitting
to it and gaining something out of it at the end.

<hr>

My plan consists of a couple of things that are mainly centered around
myself, as I don't want to give highlight to any of the 3rd-parties
involved which may be friends, family, etc. I may still often rant
about them in the journals but my overall focused will be worked so
that they are not anywhere in the image.

My whole childhood has been filled with trauma and self doubt, and the
last thing I want to have is to think about these nobody people who are
so full of themselves, that they think they have a grip around
anybodies life - I'm gonna shatter their minds and stop them in tracks
because I am so fed up with these people "flexing" around and talking
shit behind my back.

It's time I start working on my own projects and make big bucks, work
hard, sleep on time, plan things out as thoroughly as possible but also
plan things out in a way where I don't waste the majority of my day
on "planning things out".

Remove distractions, phones, social media, news sites, etc.

Maybe even create a second version of the journal specifically meant
for documenting the work I'm doing and provide information to myself
for my own reasons.

Spend the following months building xPeek to replace many of the
shit tools that these security researchers are using, basically
collect, categorize, automate, and inspect all the things I need
to know about an application, and hopefully collect big bucks in
the process as well.

One day you'll see me driving an old school Subaru Impreza WRX,
you pretentious assholes.
