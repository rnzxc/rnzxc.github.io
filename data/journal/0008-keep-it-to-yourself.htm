<h1><b>2023-09-30</b> Keep it to yourself.</h1>

<pre>
Long time no see,

Anyways, I'm writing this post as a disclaimer to myself in the
future...

Most of the small talk topics either surrounding my own stories
and occurences, or someone elses, should be kept to myself.

I am very incapable of keeping things to myself, the fact of me
writing these "journals" itself should automatically confirm that
fact.

Or maybe this is because the people I'm trapped/surrounded with
are just plain dumbfucks who are not even worth stressing about,
but I seem to enjoy the adrenaline rush and that burst of extra
power and energy to start boasting about my own intricate issues,
either it be psychological or just plain philosophical, either
way you turn to is just a bunch of nonsense nobody should stress
themselves about.

I even spoke to a couple of my "friends" about this security
research thing I'm doing, but as I grow older and become wiser,
I notice that such tendencies are a great approach to ruining
oneself in the future, is that also a philosophical statement,
is it a theory?  Perhaps, but I can't stop noticing a downward
spiral in my own personal life and my hobby work when I do so.

That in my opinion means it's real, it's self-proven.

So why do I say that?  Because it's so easy to fall into your
trap, that trap is grandiosity, more specifically for me it is
the belief of accomplishment before the work even took place.

If you read my previous journals, which I don't recommend you do
as mostly all of them are a waste of time, and are just ramblings
and make no sense at all in a chronological order... you'll see
in those journals that I may have spoken about accomplishing
things, yes, that's a form of grandiosity, plus the colorful
language I almost always incorporate in one of my journals, but
maybe there'll be a day when I don't ;)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Enough of this nonsense, let's get to some _Updates_.

It's been a month after my "It's on" journal, and I have made
some _significant_ progress in my own local _tribe_ of todo tasks
and accomplishments.

For the past 2 weeks I've been continously reshaping my daily
routine, I go to bed at 9 PM and wake up at 5 to 6 AM, I then do
all the ordinary morning stuff, then go on the computer and start
typing away at the code and finish the leftover tasks from my
backlog that spans almost a year and a half (1.5 years).

Regarding security research work, minor progress there but as I'm
closing in with the nonsense backlog tasks, after I cover that all
up then I can fully focus on security research and the fields
within it.

To add extra to that, to accomodate for this "limitation" regarding
time, energy, and whatnot, I now roughly dedicate the time between
6 AM and 3 PM which is 15 hours, as the amount of time I spend
working on security research, the other leftover 6 hours is used
for programming work, building libraries, algorithms, tools,
applications, etc.

And also, I am looking to completely cut off communications with
the people I know, and keep contacts with my relative ones, that's
it.

... and the thing is, it has just started.

I used to back down so many times as a teenager, but not anymore.

See you in a couple of months.
