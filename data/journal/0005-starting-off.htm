<h1><b>2023-08-04</b> Starting off</h1>

<pre>
Once I finish some annoying tasks I've got piling up for weeks then I'm
gonna go ahead and start decoding the source code from the Docker
images related to GitHub.

It is time to begin working, the journals will slow down from here, as
I need to focus on getting fucking money and building my skill in the
process.

I've said I'm going to explain some things from previous journals, and
I will when I got the time and nerves.
