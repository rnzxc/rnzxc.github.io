<h1><b>2024-01-09</b> Abundance of social media is a cure</h1>

<pre>
I literally spent 24 hours without social media sites, apps, or any
other entertainment media, like YouTube as one example, and I'm
feeling absolutely thrilled for "life".

I feel like I want to do great things, and not be exhausted by it.

Truly an amazing endeavour.

You must consider doing it, it'll make you more productive and sane
in the long run.

Already has for me, in 24 hours!
