<h1><b>2023-08-03</b> Same old story</h1>

<pre>
I fucked up my sleep schedule again, partly thanks to the assholes
I've been "hanging out" with, so always wanna go for a walk in the
middle of the god damn night.

But either way, I'm still clinging onto trying to do meaningful things
throughout the day, without being controlled by external forces,
emotional or physical, especially in regards to the "human" beings I
surrounded myself with, by choice or sheer so called "fate".

<hr>

I woke up around 12 PM because I went to bed around 3:30 AM, instead
of going to sleep early my brother asked me if I can install Windows
11 on his PC and me being the "good" person as I always fucking am, I
said sure and wasted a good amount of 2 and a half hours installing
the system on his laptop.

This of course amounted to absolutely nothing, it served no purpose
other than to experience something "new" but not necessarily "better".

Going back to my room I continued working on meaningless tasks until
I eventually realized the time and went to bed to browse on the phone
a little bit - this was of course a mistake as I wasted a good amount
of 30 minutes there as well - therefore next time I'm leaving my phone
far away from my couch, these devices are really full of shit and
non-sense in all directions possible.

<hr>

For today's tasks I don't know from the top of my head what I want to
do, but I do want to do some house chores first, make the place nice
so I can feel nice as well, and then get onto doing "meaningful"
tasks in regards to this computer-science-based-shit that probably
makes me even more miserable, but it's a good antidote for the overall
situation in my life, and my overall existence in the first place.

As I am writing this the GitHub's source code is being downloaded, I
acquired it through their Enterpise images that companies use to host
their internal instance of GitHub. The reason I'm downloading this
truckload of intertwined shitcode is so I can investigate the internals
of GitHub and maybe find a bug in it, and earn some cash so I can ease
off a little bit knowing that I didn't put my precious time into
nothing, and I don't mean that in a sarcastic way. Throughout my teen
years I've been mostly doing computerish things that were not at all
interesting or productive, and it was mostly shitposting content I made
with my other friend who's a retard and who got extensively
reprogrammed by my rhetoric about "getting rid of people who have bad
influence on you" but the truth is you can't change people so they fit
your expectations and opinions, nor should you do that, and that was a
really stupid approach I took as a teenager trying to help a "friend"
out in his difficult times. Only thing is I never got help from anybody
when I was in difficult times, so must be fun I guess. Either way, this
guy pretends to be "smart" and "woke" ... HAHAHAHAH ... but he himself
is continually in a perpetual motion of reinforcing bad memories and
behaviors, and doing meaningless shit that nobody actually cares about,
the only intriguing part to me is for how long this has been going on,
it's really amazing and also sad, but I won't be sad for someone who
simply doesn't want to change themselves, and is partly to the reason
as to why I'm usually avoiding these people from now on, and my overall
social circle as I've pointed out in my previous journal, one day I'm
gonna leave Bosnia and never look back.

These people deserved what they got in the 90s.

And after all of that nonsense, they are still brainwashed no matter
what happens or has already happened.

<hr>

I am not sorry for going off on a tangent because this is who I am, I
have a lot of things to say, to share, and to simply express myself in
the fullest form possible, even if it means to deviate from the main
topic.

That's it for now, I'll write more when I got the urge and nerves to do
so, and I'll rehearse the previous key points in the "Social circle"
journal which I haven't gotten around to expanding upon, lots of topics
were shared there but not actually thoroughly acted upon in terms of
writing and explaining what I meant and how I feel about those.
