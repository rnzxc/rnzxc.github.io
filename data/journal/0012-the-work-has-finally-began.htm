<h1><b>2024-01-08</b> The work has finally began</h1>

<pre>
Today I managed to write a decent portion of the code for a tool
that doesn't exist on the internet.

Unfortunately I would want to release it to the public, but that
would just give in more competition, so I will not.

And also I must make money someday, and with the current state of
living that I'm in, it would not grant me any benefit whatsoever if
I became an open-source developer.  The stakes are too high.

Taking into account what I'm doing here is also high effort and the
probable outcome of positive achievements can still be low, but I
think that going past "motivation" and more so into "discipline"
teritory is the way people should go about anything in their lives.

Tomorrow I'm finishing the tool, alongside the 2nd output format
which I'm yet to figure out how it'll work, but basically I need to
display 'diff' information between files based on their attributes.

Sounds simple and easy in theory, but a pain in the ass in practice.

It becomes especially true when you've got multi-dimensional
structures involved, and you have to find a way to meaningfully
differentiate from one another.

Wish me luck.
