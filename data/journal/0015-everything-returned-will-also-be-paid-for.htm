People seem to be always on the lookout to fuck someone over time
and time again.

I had planned with a so called <i>friend</i> to go and visit him
and have some fun playing games, browsing the internet, just regular
chilling you know.  So I basically had to pause all my plans and
work, to actually find time to go there and to be respected of
everyone's choice.

Sent a message to him asking "Hey, should I come?" and this ugly
and smelly cocksucker kept on playing "Rust" without even replying
to my question.

Tried calling him once on Discord, but nah, no response.

THESE are the types of people Sam Hyde talked about, THESE are the
types of toxic waste shiteaters that are on the lookout to crawl
under your skin, and obliterate your nervous system with their
toxic behavior.

Literally went on Discord the 1st day, the guy told me hey wanna
come over have some fun, this that, I had a motorbike accident so
I'm free at home - and me being me (always wanting to make everybody
happy) I said sure.

Just to be later ghosted by that person.

If you didn't want me coming over you cocksucking CUNT you could've
just said Sorry, some other time.

These druggies always seem to be <i>present</i> when it's about
getting one over somebody, but to do anything of actual meaning or
just to be a fucking human being after all - fuck nah.

That shit will never happen with these assholes.
