Welcome to my world from a different side, a different pespective.
I let my thoughts flow around here. Of course it's easy when you
don't expose your true name and just use an alias, like every other
jerk on the internet. Anyways enjoy I guess.

This page uses XHR to list available journals.
If no results appear switch to a more modern browser for gods sake.

This page is limited to 72 characters per row, you can hack away at
the CSS to make it not so limited, but you'll be met with the PRE
tags which you'll also need to hack away at, just don't bother.

As I've stated at the top, I let my thoughts flow around here, that
also includes colorful language, If you're a squirmy person then
close this page immediately, delete all history and don't look back
ever again, this applies to people who also easily get butthurt.

So yeah keep on getting butthurt, as if that's going to change
anything you stupid.
